# Linear tracking perturbation in GEANT4
Reference: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15622671
* An attempt to mimic the spatial uncertainity in GEANT4 simulations;
* One can use or modify accordingly for his/her own objectives by replacing the corresponding SteppingAction file;
* One is suppsoed to use the executable+run1.mac without any change to employ the GEANT4 package appropriately;
* If/when necessary, one is supposed to remove/close the visualization macro (vis.mac) in run1.mac to prevent any possible computer crash.
